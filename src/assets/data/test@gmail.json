One of my favorite hobbies is taking german lessons, because I've always loved to learn new languages and I think that's very important, I speak spanish, english and basic german. I also enjoy going out with my friends to the cinema, to a coffee shop, to have dinner, to get some ice cream in order to catch up on what's new in our lives.",
